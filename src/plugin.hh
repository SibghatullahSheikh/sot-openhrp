      /// \brief OpenHRP plugin to control HRP2
      ///
      /// This plug-in plugs dynamic-graph into the OpenHRP
      /// architecture. This class implements a custom OpenHRP
      /// plug-in.
      ///
      /// An OpenHRP plug-in provides both CORBA requests for
      /// asynchronous/non real-time changes and a control loop
      /// executed in a real-time context.
      ///
      /// The real-time part gathers the setup, control and cleanup
      /// methods respectively called during initialization, every
      /// control loop and when the plug-in is destroyed. This plug-in
      /// is controlled by a Python script running in OpenHRP
      /// (GrxUi.sh). In Python, setup and destroy are mapped to the
      /// start and stop commands.
      ///
      /// As setup and cleanup are executed in the real time loop,
      /// additional start/stop custom procedures are provided to
      /// allow long initialization (i.e. parsing the robot model,
      /// etc). These are the start and stop methods of this class.
      /// They can be accessed in the Python script through the
      /// generic sendMsg command (commands are respectively
      /// initialize and finalize).
      ///
      /// To finish, the entity_ attribute creates the device that
      /// will be used in dynamic-graph. A device provides the robot
      /// state to the graph and receives the control at the end of
      /// the control loop. See stack-of-tasks.hh for more
      /// information.
