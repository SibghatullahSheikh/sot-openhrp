      /// the recomputation of the dynamic-graph to generate a new
      /// control value.

      /// during setup *ONLY*! When control is called, the control is
      /// integrated using the previous state.  The underlying reason
      /// is that the PD controller used on HRP-2 prevents any
      /// movement if the control is too small. By integrating the
      /// command, the difference between the real robot state and the
      /// wanted robot state (the set point) will increase enough to
      /// make the robot move.
      ///
      /// See also RobotSimu which provides an OpenHRP independent
      /// controller. The only difference between RobotSimu and this
      /// entity is the data forwarding between the OpenHRP framework
      /// and the dynamic-graph framework. Otherwise, both are
